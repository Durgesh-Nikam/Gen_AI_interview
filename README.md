## Response:
Here’s a **ready-to-use, clean rapid-fire sheet** for **Generative AI** questions, with concise interview-ready answers:

* * *

Q1. What are some common applications of Generative AI in real-world scenarios?
===============================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Text generation (ChatGPT, Jasper)
*   Image creation (DALL·E, MidJourney)
*   Code generation (Copilot)
*   Music/audio synthesis
*   Drug discovery and molecular design

* * *

Q2. Discuss how multimodal AI combines different types of data to improve model performance.
============================================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Integrates text, image, audio, video, etc.
*   Models learn cross-modal relationships
*   Example: Image captioning → uses image + text jointly

* * *

Q3. Why is multimodal learning important in modern AI applications?
===================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Handles diverse real-world data
*   Improves accuracy and context understanding
*   Enables richer, human-like interactions

* * *

Q4. Give examples of real-world applications that use multimodal Generative AI.
===============================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Chatbots with image and text inputs
*   Visual question answering (VQA)
*   Autonomous vehicles (camera + lidar + radar data)
*   Medical imaging analysis

* * *

Q5. What is Fine-tuning?
========================

**Answer:**

*   Process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset

* * *

Q6. Describe the Fine-tuning process.
=====================================

**Answer:**

1.  Start with pre-trained model
2.  Provide task-specific labeled data
3.  Train on new data (small learning rate)
4.  Validate & adjust hyperparameters
5.  Deploy task-adapted model

* * *

Q7. What are the different Fine-tuning methods?
===============================================

**Answer:**

*   Full model fine-tuning
*   Feature-based transfer (train only last layers)
*   LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
*   Prompt-tuning / Adapter layers

* * *

Q8. When should you go for fine-tuning?
=======================================

**Answer:**

*   Domain-specific tasks
*   Complex datasets not well-covered by general pre-trained models
*   Improving model accuracy for specific outputs

* * *

Q9. What is the difference between Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning?
=====================================================================

**Answer:**

*   **Transfer Learning:** Use pre-trained model features for a new task (may freeze layers)
*   **Fine-tuning:** Further train the model weights on task-specific data

* * *

Q10. What is fine-tuning in LLMs, and why is it done?
=====================================================

**Answer:**

*   Adapting a large language model to domain-specific knowledge or style
*   Done to improve relevance, reduce errors, or handle specialized vocabulary

* * *

Q11. How would you build an LLM-based question-answering system for a specific domain or complex dataset?
=========================================================================================================

**Answer:**

1.  Preprocess & structure domain data
2.  Use embeddings for semantic search
3.  Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
4.  Fine-tune LLM if necessary
5.  Integrate with query interface and evaluate answers

* * *

Q12. What do you do when your LLM gives inconsistent answers for the same question?
===================================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Use context windows and prompt engineering
*   Apply RAG for reliable sources
*   Ensemble multiple model outputs
*   Fine-tune on consistent datasets

* * *

Q13. Explain the text generation difference between RAG and direct language models (LLM).
=========================================================================================

**Answer:**

*   **Direct LLM:** Generates answers solely from learned parameters
*   **RAG:** Retrieves relevant documents first → generates answers grounded in retrieved info

* * *

Q14. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and how does it differ from traditional generation models?
=============================================================================================================

**Answer:**

*   Combines retrieval + generation
*   Traditional LLM generates from memory; RAG uses external knowledge base → more accurate, up-to-date answers

* * *

Q15. What are some common applications of RAG in AI?
====================================================

**Answer:**

*   Domain-specific Q&A (legal, medical, enterprise docs)
*   Knowledge base search and summarization
*   Customer support chatbots
*   Research literature exploration

* * *

If you want, I can **merge all your AI + ML + Generative AI Q&A into one single “mega rapid-fire sheet”** formatted for copy-paste, so you have **one complete interview-ready document**.

Do you want me to do that?
